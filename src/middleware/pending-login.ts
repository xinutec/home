/**
 * The pending half of a Nextcloud SSO login, carried in a signed cookie.
 *
 * **Why not the `state` parameter alone.** When the browser holds no Nextcloud
 * session, NC's `oauth2/authorize` does not redirect back to us — it bounces to its
 * own Login Flow, and drops every query parameter on the way:
 *
 *     GET …/oauth2/authorize?client_id=…&redirect_uri=…&state=f360a3be…
 *      → 303 …/login/flow?providedRedirectUri=&clientIdentifier=…
 *
 * After the sign-in it returns to the registered callback with `state=`, **empty**.
 * A server that looks the pending login up by `state` therefore cannot complete a
 * login from a cookie-less browser at all — found 2026-07-28 in the sibling
 * fleetwatch service, whose Android WebView lost its NC cookie and could never sign
 * in again.
 *
 * So the pending login travels in a cookie of our own. That binds it to the browser
 * that started the login, which is the property `state` was there to prove; `state`
 * is still sent, and still checked whenever NC gives it back. Being self-contained
 * and signed, it also survives the pod restarting mid-login, which an in-memory map
 * of pending logins does not.
 *
 * Scope: **the NC identity login**, which is the only OAuth home does. The siblings
 * this pattern came from keep an in-memory pending entry for providers that return
 * `state` faithfully and hold a PKCE `codeVerifier` that has no business in a cookie.
 *
 * Residual risk, accepted deliberately: when NC returns an empty `state` the cookie
 * is the only binding, so a login-CSRF would become possible for someone who can land
 * a callback in the victim's browser inside the 10-minute window. The alternative is a
 * login that cannot be performed at all.
 *
 * ⚠ **home is on the public internet**, unlike the sibling this text came from — so
 * "who can reach the host" narrows that window for nobody. What limits the damage here
 * is what the session can do rather than who can reach it: every read on this host is
 * public already, and the only thing sign-in unlocks is writing an attributed line to
 * `POST /api/telemetry`. A forced login writes the attacker's own name into a log.
